For this assignment, you will need to execute the following commands across all of the assignment parts:

1. This is a very similar assignment to the simple project, but in this instance you will need to reorganize the code to map to the best practices outlined in the video for this module.

2. The steps needed to complete this assignment are the following:

3. Reorganize the code to use includes and src directories appropriately

4. Make edits to the Makefile as needed

5. Run make clean build

6. Run ./bin/complex.exe > output.txt

7. Click the Validate Output (Part 1) button, which should help determine any issues with your submission.  Passing the validation step does not guarantee a passing grade but should assure that the grader will run successfully.  If the validation step fails, there is a low chance of the grader either completing or the assignment passing, so only continue to the next step after validation has succeeded.

8. Click the Submit Assignment (Part 2) button
