# CUDA Face Dataset Augmentation Project

## Overview

This project uses NVIDIA's CUDA and NPP (NVIDIA Performance Primitives) library to generate synthetic training data from the CMU Face Images dataset provided by the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository. The application performs GPU-accelerated image transformations to each image in the dataset to augment face image datasets for training machine learning models. This project can easily be expanded to include other file types and NPP image transformation operations.

**Key Features:**
- Batch processing of all PGM images in the CMU Face dataset
- GPU-accelerated image flipping augmentation using NPP's `nppiMirror_8u_C1R`
- Generates 2 augmented variants per original image
- Cross-platform support (Linux/Windows)

**Use Case:** Data augmentation for face detection and recognition model training, significantly expanding training datasets without requiring additional manual data collection.

## Installation

From the Coursera lab environment, clone the repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BrendanCook44/GPU-Programming-Specialization.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd GPU-Programming-Specialization/
cd Course\ 3\ -\ CUDA\ at\ Scale\ for\ the\ Enterprise/
cd CUDA\ at\ Scale\ Independent\ Project/
```

## Running the Application

To execute the application, run the following commands from inside the CUDA at Scale Independent Project folder:

```bash
make clean build
make run
```

## Viewing Results

After running the program, navigate to the `data/faces` folder to see the augmented images. The transformed images will be marked with `_aug` to indicate augmentation.

To view the images, download them and open them in a PGM file viewer to see the image modifications. An example output is provided under `data/output results/` that shows an original unmodified image and the augmented versions of the image for visualization of program output.

## Code Organization

```bin/```
Contains the compiled `project` executable generated by the build process. This binary performs GPU-accelerated image augmentation on face datasets.

```data/```
Should contain the CMU Face Images dataset in a `faces/` subdirectory. The program recursively processes all PGM image files found within this directory structure. Augmented output images are saved alongside the originals to visualize program functionality.

```libs/```
CUDA helper libraries and NPP utility headers required for the project:
- CUDA helper functions (`helper_cuda.h`, `helper_string.h`, etc.)
- NPP utility classes in `UtilNPP/` for image handling (`ImagesCPU.h`, `ImagesNPP.h`, `ImageIO.h`)
- OpenGL headers in `GL/` for graphics support
- Pre-compiled libraries in `lib/x64/`

```src/```
Source code for the image augmentation pipeline:
- `project.cpp` - Main application source file

```README.md```
Project documentation describing the face dataset augmentation system, its features, and usage instructions.

```Makefile```
Build configuration using NVCC compiler with C++17 standard. Compiles CUDA/C++ code and links against NPP and FreeImage libraries.
