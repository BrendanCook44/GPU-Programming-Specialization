# CUDA Face Dataset Augmentation Project

## Overview

This project uses NVIDIA's CUDA and NPP (NVIDIA Performance Primitives) library to generate synthetic training data from the CMU Face Images dataset provided by the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository. The application performs GPU-accelerated image transformations including random rotations (0-360°) and horizontal flips to augment face image datasets for training machine learning models.

**Key Features:**
- Batch processing of all PGM images in the CMU Face dataset
- GPU-accelerated image rotation using NPP's `nppiRotate_8u_C1R`
- GPU-accelerated horizontal flipping using NPP's `nppiMirror_8u_C1R`
- Random transformations to generate diverse training data
- Generates 3 augmented variants per original image
- Cross-platform support (Linux/Windows)

**Use Case:** Data augmentation for face detection and recognition model training, significantly expanding training datasets without requiring additional data collection.

## Code Organization

```bin/```
Contains the compiled `project` executable generated by the build process. This binary performs GPU-accelerated image augmentation on face datasets.

```data/```
Should contain the CMU Face Images dataset in a `faces/` subdirectory. The program recursively processes all PGM image files found within this directory structure. Augmented output images are saved alongside the originals.

```libs/```
CUDA helper libraries and NPP utility headers required for the project:
- CUDA helper functions (`helper_cuda.h`, `helper_string.h`, etc.)
- NPP utility classes in `UtilNPP/` for image handling (`ImagesCPU.h`, `ImagesNPP.h`, `ImageIO.h`)
- OpenGL headers in `GL/` for graphics support
- Pre-compiled libraries in `lib/x64/`

```src/```
Source code for the image augmentation pipeline:
- `project.cpp` - Main application implementing GPU-accelerated rotation and flipping using NPP

```README.md```
Project documentation describing the face dataset augmentation system, its features, and usage instructions.

```INSTALL```
Installation instructions for setting up the project in the Coursera lab environment for peer review.

```Makefile```
Build configuration using NVCC compiler with C++17 standard. Compiles CUDA/C++ code and links against NPP and FreeImage libraries.
